# SignalReconstruction
The project contains the code for the signal reconstruction at Scale project.


# Description

1- The SR folder contains the C++ code for the DIRECT and the approximation algorithms.

2- The Python folder contains the code for generating the inputs to the algorithm.

Contact Abolfazl Asudeh or Jees Augustine if you have any questions.
